## About me
I'm 45 years old. Currently I work at the Belarusian Railways as a team leader. I have 28 people under my direct supervision. We are engaged in maintenance and operation of telephone and telegraph communications equipment. I began to understand that my profession was slowly fading away, and now it was not too late to change my occupation to a more promising one. So I decided to become a front-end developer.

## Skills
+ HTML
+ CSS
+ JavaScript (Basic)
+ Git/Github

# Expirience
I have some experience in application development. I developed, wrote and maintain to this day a billing system and related applications for a departmental PBX. The development was carried out in the Lazarus environment (freepascal), using the Firebird database.

## Education
+ Brest College of Railway Transport (1996) - maintenance and repair of automated control systems in railway transport
+  Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics (2004) - Telecommunication systems

## Languages:

## Code example
````
function clickReal(D) {
var Z = Number(document.getElementById('screen').innerText);

	operationFlag = true;
    switch (D) {
    	case 'S': Z = Math.sqrt(Z);
              	 break;   
        case 'P': Z=Z;
              	 break;   				 				 
		case 'R': Z = 1 / Z;
              	 break;   				 
		case 'PM': if (Z<0) {Z = Math.abs(Z)} else {Z = 0 - Z};
              	 break;
	   }
    
   document.getElementById('screen').innerText = Z;   	
}
